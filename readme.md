# GMDSP Sample App

This is a sample app I setup to experiment with the following things:

GMDSP data sets: (www.gmdsp.org.uk)
Broccoli: (https://github.com/joliss/broccoli)
Ember: (http://emberjs.com/)

This is a constantly evolving work in progress so please do not take anything as canon.

# Instructions

See [Brocfile.js](/Brocfile.js) for the build definition.

To start the server, run:

```
npm install -g bower
bower install

npm install

npm install -g broccoli-cli
broccoli serve
```
